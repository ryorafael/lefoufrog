# Le Fou Frog Restaurant

This is a reconfiguration of my first project https://github.com/ryorafael/personal-project-lff that I have decided to change the language to next.js rather than using vanilla js. This project was mostly completeled in HTML, CSS, and javascript, but now we will be using next.js and tailwinds.css for front end.
